4.0.5
=====
Timer around entire multi-get reads

4.0.4
=====
Metrics for id services in multi-get

4.0.3
=====
Naive implementation of multiget for the map db harness.

4.0.2
=====
Add metrics around retrying after IOExceptions when flushing to hbase
and apply some jittered backoff as retry attempts increase.

4.0.1
=====
Removes `bufferpool`, `garbagecollector`, and `memorypool` metrics from static `Metrics` registry.
If clients would like these metrics to be reported on they can be added manually.

4.0.0
=====
Modifies how JmxReporter does object naming.

3.0.0
=====
Updates metrics library to io.dropwizard.metrics instead of com.yammer.metrics. This will
cause slight changes in the naming of metrics. Fixes bug where a checkAndPut
operation checking for absence of a cell value is done with an empty array instead of
a null value.

2.0.0
=====
Non compatible update with existing data cubes.  The DataCube constructor in
previous versions with the useAddressPrefixByteHash parameter set to true is
compatible with PREFIX_MODE.NO_ADDRESS_PREFIX, but is not compatible with the
new mode PREFIX_MODE.MOD_ADDRESS_PREFIX because there was a bug since 1.4.0
that didn't implement this feature correctly.

1.5.0
=====
Prevent getId calls from creating a new identifier
Add a getOrCreateId Method to the idmapper interface
Optimize id creation.

1.4.0
=====
Add functionality to optionally add a hash in front of row keys, which permits
users to ignore dimension order when considering performance.

1.3.0
=====
Add on-success callback to the HBaseDbharness
Update many dependencies and increase minor version, 1.2.x -> 1.3.0
Support multiGet
Fix bug in Cas operations
Add Double op

Allow for larger caches that will invalidate under memory pressure.
Expose cache metrics.
Redesign bucketer system for multiple buckets per dimension
Add release notes
Add instructions/workflow for doing a release
Add worked example about counting tweets, initial simple version
Include tests as a build artifact




1.2.3

Deprecated RollupFilter in favor of low-level Address/Batch access
Bug fix for overcounting in hbase backfill merger when cubes share a table
Bug fix for EnumSerializable returning incorrect values
